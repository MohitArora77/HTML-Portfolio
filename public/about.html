<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Iâ€™m a passionate web development beginner with a strong desire to turn creative ideas into functional web applications. 
  My journey began when I started experimenting with HTML and CSS, and I quickly realized how much I enjoyed bringing designs to life. 
  Since then, I've been expanding my knowledge by learning JavaScript, exploring frameworks like React, and building small projects to hone my skills.</p>

<p>I thrive on solving problems and am always eager to learn new technologies. Currently, 
  I'm focused on deepening my understanding of front-end development and plan to explore back-end technologies soon.</p>
  
  <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy listening to various podcast,music,play online games, which often inspires my work. 
  I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and contribute to innovative projects. Feel free to connect with me to discuss web development, collaboration opportunities, or just to say hello</p>
